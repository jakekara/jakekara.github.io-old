  <h2>OCaml algebraic data types and pattern matching</h2>
  <div class="post-meta">Oct 14, 2016</div>
  <div class="post-body">
    <p>I wrote a royal flush simulator in OCaml just to not forget the language.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jakekara/ocaml-cardstuff">Here it is</a></p>

<p>OCaml is cool. I took a class, Abstraction and Design in Computation, that
used OCaml exclusively. It was a good language for that class because we
began with functional programming, including using modules and functors,
and then moved to object oriented programming. It handles both paradigms
well.</p>

<p>A fellow programmer who doesn’t write functional code asked why I liked
OCaml after taking this class, and I told him about algebraic data
types. The best example I could think of was expressing a deck of cards in
code, which is certainly possible in any programming paradigm and language,
but I think much more pleasant in OCaml.</p>

<p>Here’s an algebraic data type I defined to represet card faces (in cards.ml):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">face_value</span> <span class="p">=</span>
  <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Ace</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Two</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Three</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Four</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Five</span>
  <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Six</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Seven</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Eight</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Nine</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Ten</span>
  <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Jack</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Queen</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">King</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I did the same thing to define a type for suits…</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="c">(* Type for card suits*)</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">suit</span> <span class="p">=</span>
  <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Diamonds</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Clubs</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Hearts</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nc">Spades</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>… and then defined a card as a suit, face tuple:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="c">(* Type for cards *)</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">card</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">suit</span> <span class="p">*</span> <span class="n">face_value</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now I could use variables to represent each face value and assign a numeric
value, but that has a few drawbacks.</p>

<p>First of all, because face_value is a type now, OCaml will handle
enforcement anywhere you specificy you want a face_value. You don’t have to
just use an int and then check every time that it’s within the specified
range.</p>

<p>Second, it’s easier to read.</p>

<p>Third, with OCaml’s pattern matching, I now use these types to write
relatively readable, and short, code to test for a royal flush:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="c">(* Test whether hand is a royal flush *)</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">royal_flush</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hand</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">card</span> <span class="kt">list</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="p">=</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">suit</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">_</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nn">List</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">nth</span> <span class="n">hand</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="k">in</span>
  <span class="n">hands_match</span> <span class="n">hand</span>
    <span class="o">([(</span><span class="n">suit</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nc">Ace</span><span class="o">);(</span><span class="n">suit</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nc">King</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">suit</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nc">Queen</span><span class="o">);(</span><span class="n">suit</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nc">Jack</span><span class="o">);(</span><span class="n">suit</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nc">Ten</span><span class="o">)])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This method takes a hand (a list of items of type card) and then tests if
it matches the “pattern” for a royal flush. A royal flush contains an Ace,
King, Queen, Jack and Ten, all of the same suit. I take the “suit” of the
first card, and then test whether the pattern holds. Notice that “suit” is
a variable.</p>

<p>I believe the above code is much more elegant and readable than could
otherwise be written without pattern matching and algebraic data types.</p>

<p>I don’t get to use OCaml in my daily work, and I miss it.</p>
